## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS - TailwindCSS - Using the cdn option for working with a local static index html 





### What I learned

I'm into the project based learning and this seems to be a well documented and supportedframework or activity.
I am just trying to get the process down with this first experiment., I did learn quite a bit aboutall the little thingsfor working with the files and creating this readme for example.Right now I'm trying to figure out how to get screenshots intoa file and displayed in a read me.
I would say that it underlines the need to create projects and not just watch videos or take notes. Building with your "hands" is important.

### Continued development

Creating a simple card is how modern web development is done so right off the bat I feel a little more comfortable with creating these component cards.

### Useful resources

I used a Brad TraverseC tailwindCSS tutorialto guideme and thetailwindCss.com documentation.
